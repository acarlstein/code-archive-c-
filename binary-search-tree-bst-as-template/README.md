## Example of Binary Search Tree (BST) as template by using vectors, iterators, and time STL from 2010

NOTIFICATION: These examples are provided for educational purposes. Using this code is under your own responsibility and risk. The code is given ‘as is’. I do not take responsibilities of how they are used.

Please notice that as an example, the first tree will have all the nodes to the left, the the second tree will have all the nodes to the right, and the third tree will be balance.

Since the second tree have to check first to the left and then to the right it will take more time than the first tree. Also since the third tree is balance it will find faster the values than the second tree
