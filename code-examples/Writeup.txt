Alejandro G. Carlstein - Lab 9

The first tree will have all the nodes to the left.

The second tree will have all the nodes to the right.

The third tree will be balance.

Since the second tree have to check first to the left and then to the right
it will take more time than the first tree. 

Also since the third tree is balance it will find faster 
the values than the second tree
